To continue with development it is crucial that we have a means of transmitting information.  This will be in the form of a bus. 

A generic bus is necessary to implement/test protocols such as Arinc 739, or even 429 buses. 

Questions:  
Should the busses be time-aware?
  - Some protocols have baud limitations that we could observe to make this realistic.
  - We can define repetitive intervals to transmit certain words
  - We can appropriately simulate time-intervals
  Yes, therefore I think we should be time-aware.  
What is the best way to make these time-aware?
  - They can rely on system time.  However this may not be in sync with any real-time scheduler, especially if rates are manually manipulated or if over-runs are experienced on the rest of the system. 
  - They can rely on a dt to be passed at a regular interval.  This may complicate the interface, and require repetitive function calls.  It also requires the client to be time-aware which may not be the case.
